        In the scrapy doc there are two ways to tell scrapy where to begin to
        crawl from.  One is start_requests, the other is start_urls which is
        shortcut to the start_requestt.

        Based on my experience, it is better to use start_requests instead of
        start_urls bacause in this methods you can know how the request object
        are created and how request is yield. You should keep it simple and
        try not to use some magic or it might confuse you.

        In this project, you have no need to change code in this method, just
        modify code in parse_entry_page

        If you fully understatnd how scrapy work, then you are free to choose
        between start_requests and start_urls.
